Priority Score = (Impact × 2) + Urgency + Effort Bonus
```

Where:
- **Impact** (1-5): Business and technical impact
- **Urgency** (1-5): Time sensitivity  
- **Effort Bonus**: Small=+3, Medium=+2, Large=+1, XL=0

Recommended order (though most can be parallelized):

1. **Jetty 12 Upgrade** - Foundation for extended support
2. **Security Audit** - Critical for release
3. **Drools Test Coverage** - Quality assurance
4. **PostgreSQL Documentation** - Improves onboarding
5. **Database Performance** - User experience enhancement
