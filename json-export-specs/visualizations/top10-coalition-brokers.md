## Swedish Political Context

Sweden's minority government system requires constant coalition-building. The current government (M-KD-L with 107 seats) relies on SD support (73 seats) for a working majority. This necessitates skilled brokers who can maintain coalition unity while securing external support. Cross-party collaboration is also essential on specific issues like defense, where broad parliamentary consensus is tradition.
