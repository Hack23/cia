With roots in the labor movement, the party has been Sweden's largest for over a century, governing for most of the 20th century. Current policy priorities include climate transition, welfare system protection, labor market regulation, and Nordic cooperation. The party maintains strong ties with trade unions and represents urban workers and public sector employees. Recent electoral challenges include competition from Sweden Democrats on immigration and from Left Party on economic policy."
