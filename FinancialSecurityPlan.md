### High-Level Perspective

This financial plan provides a structured and cost-efficient deployment for your application infrastructure in the **AWS eu-west-1 (Ireland)** region. It integrates key components of scalability, security, and resilience to support critical workloads while maintaining budgetary control.

For detailed deployment architecture, see the [AWS Infrastructure documentation](AWS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).

#### Core Highlights
1. **Scalability & Resilience:** Single EC2 instance optimized for performance and costs, with an optional High Availability (HA) solution for redundancy.
2. **Cybersecurity Measures:** AWS WAF, CloudWatch Logs, and secure S3 storage for logs safeguard the application from cyber threats while supporting compliance.
3. **Cost Optimization:** Leverages AWS Graviton-based instances for better price-performance ratios.
4. **Resilience Tracking:** AWS Resilience Hub ensures operational readiness and business continuity.
