This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

Number of sources indicates the number of underlying data sources on which the aggregate estimate is based.

The WGI are based on a large number of different data sources, capturing the views and experiences of survey respondents and experts in the public and private sectors, as well as various NGOs. These data sources include: (a) surveys of households and firms (e.g. Afrobarometer surveys, Gallup World Poll, and Global Competitiveness Report survey), (b) NGOs (e.g. Global Integrity, Freedom House, Reporters Without Borders), (c) commercial business information providers (e.g. Economist Intelligence Unit, S&P Global, Political Risk Services), and (d) public sector organizations (e.g. CPIA assessments of World Bank and regional development banks). 

Government Effectiveness captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.","Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org, note: The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a product of the staff of the World Bank with external contributions.",1996,2023,25,Public Sector

PPPs account for the different price levels across countries and thus PPP-based comparisons of economic output are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants than exchange-rate based comparisons. 

Gross domestic product is the total income earned through the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production approach. The core indicator has been divided by the general population to achieve a per capita estimate. This indicator is expressed in constant prices, meaning the series has been adjusted to account for price changes over time. The reference year for this adjustment is 2021. The PPP conversion factor is a currency conversion factor and a spatial price deflator. PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries, thereby allowing volume or output comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components.","International Comparison Program (ICP), World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp/data, note: This information is for ICP’s PPPs utilized in WDI, publisher: International Comparison Program (ICP), date accessed: May 30, 2024, date published: May 30, 2024;

RL.PER.RNK.UPPER,DK,"Rule of Law: Percentile Rank, Upper Bound of 90% Confidence Interval",2,World Development Indicators,"Good governance is essential for development. It helps countries improve economic growth, build human capital, and strengthen social cohesion. Empirical evidence shows a strong causal relationship between better governance and better development outcomes. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are designed to help researchers and analysts assess broad patterns in perceptions of governance across countries and over time. The WGI cover over 200 countries and territories, measuring six dimensions of governance starting in 1996: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and NGO sector experts worldwide

Rule of Law captures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. 

Percentile rank indicates the country's rank among all countries covered by the aggregate indicator, with 0 corresponding to lowest rank, and 100 to highest rank.  Percentile ranks have been adjusted to correct for changes over time in the composition of the countries covered by the WGI.    

Percentile Rank Upper refers to upper bound of 90 percent confidence interval for governance, expressed in percentile rank terms.","Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Bank (WB), uri: www.govindicators.org, note: The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a product of the staff of the World Bank with external contributions.",1996,2023,25,Public Sector
