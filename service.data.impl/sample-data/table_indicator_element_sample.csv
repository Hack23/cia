When reading Informational Texts, students at the informational level can A) Locate and reproduce two or three pieces of information from within the text, and B) Use subheadings, text boxes, and illustrations to locate parts of the text. The procedure for identifying International Benchmarks changed from the PIRLS 2001 method of using percentiles to a method based on scores that do not change from PIRLS cycle to cycle. In PIRLS 2001, the Intermediate Benchmark was called the ""Median Benchmark"" (50th percentile score or median), which corresponded to a scale score of 510. The 2001 data in this database were recalculated based on a 475 Intermediate Benchmark score and are different than the data found in the 2001 PIRLS report.

Primary. 10 years of experience,12,Education Statistics,"Salaries after 10 years of experience refer to the scheduled annual salary of a full-time classroom teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified plus 10 years of experience. Salaries are in equivalent USD converted using PPPs for private consumption. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, while actual salaries refer to the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher. The salaries reported are gross (total sum paid by the employer) less the employer’s contribution to social security and pension, according to existing salary scales. Salaries are “before tax”, i.e. before deductions for income tax. Teachers’ salaries are one component of teachers’ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers’ total remuneration. There are also large differences in taxation and social-benefits systems in OECD countries. All this should be borne in mind when comparing statutory salaries across countries. Data after 2009 is not comparable to data for 2009 and before due to changes in methodology.

69453,DT.NFL.UNWT.CD,"Net official flows from UN agencies, UNWTO (current US$)",2,World Development Indicators,"Net official flows from UN agencies are the net disbursements of total official flows from the UN agencies. Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme(UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), United Nations Peacebuilding Fund (UNPBF), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR).
