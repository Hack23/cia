  Fix Empty View: view_riksdagen_crisis_resilience_indicators v1.40
  Author: Intelligence Operative & Political Analyst
  Date: 2025-12-02
  GitHub Issue: #8011 - Fix Empty View: view_riksdagen_crisis_resilience_indicators
  
  This changelog fixes view_riksdagen_crisis_resilience_indicators which returns 0 rows
  despite previous fix attempts in issues #7885, #7886 and changelogs v1.29, v1.38.
  
  Root Cause Identified:
  The view logic has three compounding issues:
  
  1. Crisis Period Detection Gap: The view defines:
     - crisis_periods: months where ballot_count > avg * 1.5
     - normal_periods: months where ballot_count <= avg
     - MISSING: months between avg and 1.5*avg are not classified
     
  2. Empty CTE Due to No Crisis Detection: If no month has > 1.5x average ballots
     (common in stable political periods), the crisis_periods CTE is empty, causing
     crisis_voting CTE to also be empty via INNER JOIN.
     
  3. Overly Strict WHERE Clause: Requires (crisis_votes > 0 OR normal_votes > 0),
     but if crisis_voting is empty and a person's votes fall in the "gap" between
     normal and crisis, they won't appear in the view.
  
  Solution:
  Replace the binary crisis/normal classification with a global, percentile-based
  approach that ensures ALL active politicians with voting activity are included:
  
  1. Classify time periods (months) as CRISIS, ELEVATED, or NORMAL based on ballot
     counts across all activity, using percentile thresholds (P75 for crisis/high-activity,
     median for elevated, below median for normal).
  2. This classification is global, not per-politician; all politicians' votes are
     analyzed within these globally defined periods.
  3. Include ALL active politicians who have ANY voting data in the analysis period,
     ensuring resilience metrics remain meaningful even without dramatic crisis periods.
  
  This ensures the view works in:
  - Databases with no data (returns 0 rows - expected)
  - Databases with vote data (returns politicians with voting activity)
  - Political periods with or without high-activity "crisis" months
  
  Impact:
  - View will return >50 rows when sufficient vote_data exists
  - All active politicians with voting history are included
  - Crisis resilience assessment remains meaningful
  - No change to column names or return types (backwards compatible)

        Fix view_riksdagen_crisis_resilience_indicators to return data
        
        Root Cause: The crisis period detection algorithm had gaps - months between
        1x and 1.5x average were not classified as either crisis or normal periods.
        Combined with INNER JOINs in CTEs, this caused empty results.
        
        Solution: Use percentile-based three-tier classification that covers ALL periods:
        - CRISIS: months with ballots >= P75 (top 25% of activity - high-pressure periods)
        - ELEVATED: months with ballots >= median but &lt; P75 (above average but not crisis)
        - NORMAL: months with ballots &lt; median (bottom 50% of activity)
        
        This ensures no classification gaps and robust detection even without
        dramatic crisis periods. The CASE statement evaluates top-to-bottom so
        P75 is checked first, ensuring correct classification when values overlap.
        
        Changes:
        - Use PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) for crisis threshold (P75)
        - Use PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) for elevated threshold (median)
        - Classify ALL months as CRISIS, ELEVATED, or NORMAL (no gaps)
        - Keep all resilience calculation logic and metrics unchanged
        - Keep all column names unchanged for backwards compatibility
