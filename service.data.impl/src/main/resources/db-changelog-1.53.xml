  Party Longitudinal Analysis Views - Database Changelog v1.53 (OPTIMIZED &amp; ENHANCED)
  Author: Intelligence Operative &amp; Political Analyst
  Date: 2026-01-15
  GitHub Issue: #8209 - Party Performance Across Election Cycles - Longitudinal Analysis (2002-2026)
  Dependencies: #8208 (Election Cycle Views v1.51), #8218 (Statistical Enhancements v1.52)
  
  OPTIMIZATIONS &amp; ENHANCEMENTS (Based on PR review feedback):
  - Builds on existing advanced party views (view_riksdagen_vote_data_ballot_party_summary_annual, 
    view_party_performance_metrics, view_party_effectiveness_trends)
  - Advanced statistical functions: RANK, PERCENT_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, STDDEV_POP
  - Swedish parliament cycle structure: autumn/spring semesters
  - Comprehensive KPIs: 25+ metrics per view for trends, monitoring, and predictions
  - Predictive indicators: Forecast scores, momentum indicators, volatility assessments
  - Trend detection: Multi-dimensional trajectory classification
  
  Purpose:
  Creates 3 comprehensive database views tracking party performance metrics across all
  election cycles (2002-2026), using Swedish parliamentary semester structure, leveraging
  existing optimized views, and providing advanced statistical analysis with comprehensive
  KPIs and predictive indicators.
  
  Swedish Parliamentary Context:
  - Election cycles: 2002-2005, 2006-2009, 2010-2013, 2014-2017, 2018-2021, 2022-2025, 2026-2029
  - Semester structure:
    * Autumn semester: September 1 - January 25 (election campaigns in cycle year 4)
    * Spring semester: January 26 - August 31 (pre-election in year 4)
  - 8 major parties: S, M, SD, C, V, KD, L, MP
  
  Advanced Statistical Features:
  1. RANK/PERCENT_RANK: Compare parties within each cycle/semester
  2. NTILE: Quartile-based performance tiers
  3. LAG/LEAD: Temporal trend detection (previous/next semester)
  4. STDDEV_POP: Volatility and consistency measurement
  5. Change percentages: Period-over-period growth rates
  6. Composite scores: Multi-metric aggregations
  7. Predictive KPIs: Forecast scores, early warning indicators
  
  Views Created (All with advanced statistics and comprehensive KPIs):
  1. view_riksdagen_party_longitudinal_performance - 30+ metrics including performance KPIs, trend indicators, predictions
  2. view_riksdagen_party_coalition_evolution - 25+ metrics including alliance KPIs, strategic shift detection, stability forecasts
  3. view_riksdagen_party_electoral_trends - 28+ metrics including electoral KPIs, growth forecasts, seat projections

        Party Coalition Evolution View (2002-2026) - OPTIMIZED &amp; ENHANCED
        
        Framework: Comparative Analysis, Network Analysis
        
        OPTIMIZATIONS:
        - Builds on view_riksdagen_vote_data_ballot_party_summary_annual
        - Leverages existing party pair voting patterns
        
        COMPREHENSIVE KPIs (25+ metrics):
        1. Core Alliance Metrics: alignment_rate, joint_votes, aligned_votes
        2. Comparative Metrics: RANK, PERCENT_RANK, NTILE by alignment strength
        3. Trend Indicators: LAG/LEAD changes, coalition trajectory
        4. Volatility Metrics: STDDEV_POP for alliance stability
        5. Predictive KPIs: coalition_forecast, stability_score, breakup_risk
        6. Strategic Indicators: shift_detection, realignment_probability
        7. Network Metrics: coalition_density, bridge_strength
        
        ENHANCEMENTS:
        - Swedish parliament semester structure
        - Advanced statistical functions for coalition analysis
        - Strategic shift detection with statistical significance
        - Predictive indicators for coalition stability/breakup
        - Network analysis metrics for coalition structure

        Party Electoral Trends View (2002-2026) - OPTIMIZED &amp; ENHANCED
        
        Framework: Comparative Analysis, Predictive Intelligence
        
        OPTIMIZATIONS:

        - Uses view_riksdagen_vote_data_ballot_party_summary_annual (win rates)
        
        COMPREHENSIVE KPIs (28+ metrics):
        1. Core Electoral Metrics: seat_count, win_rate, vote_share_proxy
        2. Comparative Metrics: RANK, PERCENT_RANK, NTILE by multiple dimensions
        3. Trend Indicators: LAG/LEAD changes, growth trajectory
        4. Volatility Metrics: STDDEV_POP for electoral stability
        5. Predictive KPIs: seat_forecast, growth_projection, election_readiness_score
