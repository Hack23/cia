  Issue: Enhancement of Hack23/cia#8211 - Politician Career Trajectory Tracking
  
  Documentation References:
  - Analysis Framework: DATA_ANALYSIS_INTOP_OSINT.md (Predictive Intelligence Framework 4)
  - Schema Maintenance: service.data.impl/README-SCHEMA-MAINTENANCE.md
  - View Catalog: DATABASE_VIEW_INTELLIGENCE_CATALOG.md
  - Base Issue: #8211 - Politician Career Trajectory Tracking Across Election Cycles
  
  Summary: Create enhanced view with 10-level hierarchical role classification system
  for comprehensive career path analysis, including party leaders, speakers, and typical
  career progression patterns vs. downward spirals.
  
  Enhancement over v1.56 career views:
  - Implements 10-level hierarchical classification (vs. 8 tier system in v1.56)
  - Adds party leader and speaker role tracking as requested
  - Enhanced career scoring with level-based KPIs
  - Typical career path detection (fast track, steady progress, stagnant, declining)
  - Downward spiral indicators (demotion velocity, consecutive demotions, exit risk)
  - Time-in-level analysis for career pacing
  - Peak sustainability metrics
  - Cross-level transition patterns
  
  10-Level Classification System:
  Level 10: Prime Minister (Statsminister) - Highest office
  Level 9:  Deputy Prime Minister / Cabinet Ministers (Vice statsminister, Statsråd)
  Level 8:  Speaker of Parliament (Talman) - Presiding officer
  Level 7:  Party Leader / Deputy Speakers (Partiledare, Vice talman)
  Level 6:  Party Secretary / Committee Chairs (Partisekreterare, Ordförande)
  Level 5:  Committee Vice Chairs (Vice ordförande)
  Level 4:  Active MPs (Riksdagsledamot) - Full parliament membership
  Level 3:  Committee Members (Ledamot in committees)
  Level 2:  Substitute MPs (Suppleant, Ersättare)
  Level 1:  Other/Entry Roles (Other assignments)
  
  Intelligence Value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ VERY HIGH
  Used for: Career path forecasting, leadership succession planning, talent retention,
  resignation risk prediction, party leader transition analysis

        Create view_riksdagen_politician_career_path_10level with comprehensive 10-level 
        hierarchical role classification system.
        
        Framework: Predictive Intelligence (Framework 4) + Temporal Analysis (Framework 1)
        
        KEY ENHANCEMENTS OVER v1.56:
        - 10-level granular classification (vs. 8 tier system)
        - Party leader and speaker roles prominently tracked
        - Career level scoring (1000-100 in 100-point increments)
        - Typical career path patterns (fast track, steady, stagnant, declining)
        - Downward spiral detection (demotion velocity, consecutive drops, exit risk)
        - Time-in-level analysis for career pacing assessment
        - Peak sustainability metrics (how long at highest level)
        - Cross-level transition matrices for progression analysis
        
        COMPREHENSIVE KPIs (40+ metrics):
        1. Career Level Classification: 10 hierarchical levels
        2. Career Scores: Numeric scoring 100-1000
        3. Progression Metrics: advancement velocity, promotion count, demotion count
        4. Peak Analysis: peak level, time at peak, peak sustainability
        5. Trajectory Patterns: career pattern classification (8 types)
        6. Downward Indicators: spiral detection, exit risk scoring
        7. Time Analysis: time-in-level, years per promotion, career span
        8. Comparative Metrics: RANK, PERCENT_RANK, NTILE by career score
        9. Trend Detection: LAG/LEAD for progression direction
        10. Volatility Metrics: STDDEV_POP for career stability
        
        Intelligence Value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ VERY HIGH
