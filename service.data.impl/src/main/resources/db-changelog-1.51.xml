  Parliamentary Session Analysis Views v1.51
  Author: Political Analyst & Intelligence Operative  
  Date: 2026-01-13
  GitHub Issue: Historical Election Cycle Trend Views for All Elections (2002-Present)
  
  This changelog creates parliamentary session analysis views using the rm column.
  Swedish Riksdag sessions (riksmöte) run September to August (e.g., "2025/26" = Sept 2025 - Aug 2026).
  
  Views created:
  1. view_riksdagen_parliamentary_session_summary - Overall session metrics
  2. view_riksdagen_politician_parliamentary_session_performance - Politician tracking per session
  3. view_riksdagen_party_parliamentary_session_trends - Party evolution across sessions
  4. view_riksdagen_parliamentary_session_comparative_analysis - Advanced LAG/LEAD analysis with z-scores
  5. view_riksdagen_politician_parliamentary_session_rankings - PERCENT_RANK & NTILE quartiles
  6. view_riksdagen_party_parliamentary_session_momentum - Moving averages & velocity/acceleration
  7. view_riksdagen_parliamentary_session_volatility_analysis - Coefficient of variation & stability scores
  8. view_riksdagen_committee_parliamentary_session_activity - DENSE_RANK & productivity tiers
  
  Key features:
  - Uses rm (riksmöte) column mapped to parliamentary_session for international understanding
  - Parliamentary sessions align with Swedish Riksdag calendar, not arbitrary 4-year election cycles
  - Proper JPA entity models with JAXB annotations
  - Advanced PostgreSQL statistics: RANK, PERCENT_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, STDDEV, moving averages, z-scores

        Create view_riksdagen_parliamentary_session_volatility_analysis
        
        Behavioral volatility analysis using coefficient of variation and stability scores.
        Identifies erratic performers and behavioral consistency patterns.
        
        Intelligence Value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH
        Important for risk assessment and behavioral pattern recognition
