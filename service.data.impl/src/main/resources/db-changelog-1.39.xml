  Fix Empty View: view_politician_risk_summary v1.39
  Author: Intelligence Operative & Political Analyst
  Date: 2025-12-01
  GitHub Issue: #8010 - Fix Empty View: view_politician_risk_summary
  
  This changelog fixes view_politician_risk_summary which returns 0 rows due to
  materialized view dependency that hasn't been populated.
  
  Root Cause Identified:
  The view depends on view_riksdagen_politician_document (materialized view) via LEFT JOIN.
  Even though it's a LEFT JOIN, PostgreSQL cannot execute the query if the materialized
  view hasn't been populated (REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW never run).
  
  Error: "materialized view 'view_riksdagen_politician_document' has not been populated"
  
  Previous Fix Attempts:
  - Changelog v1.32: Changed from annual summary to direct vote_data - INCOMPLETE (still had mat view dep)
  - Changelog v1.37: Improved vote metrics calculation - INCOMPLETE (still had mat view dep)
  - Issue #7884: Closed prematurely without fixing materialized view dependency
  - Issue #7886: Related fix that didn't address root cause
  
  Solution:
  Replace materialized view reference with direct query to base tables:
  - document_person_reference_da_0 (person-document associations)
  - document_person_reference_co_0 (container)
  - document_status_container (status)
  - document_data (metadata including made_public_date)
  
  This ensures the view works in schema-only databases and eliminates the need
  for materialized view population before risk assessment can be performed.
  
  Impact:
  - Enables politician risk assessment in fresh database installations
  - Removes dependency on materialized view refresh schedule
  - Maintains all existing risk calculation logic unchanged
  - Performance: Slightly slower but ensures data availability

        Fix view_politician_risk_summary by removing materialized view dependency
        
        Root Cause: The view uses LEFT JOIN on view_riksdagen_politician_document
        (materialized view). Even with LEFT JOIN, PostgreSQL cannot execute the
        query if the materialized view hasn't been populated with REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW.
        
        Solution: Replace the materialized view reference with a direct query to
        the underlying base tables (document_person_reference_da_0, document_data,
        document_status_container) to calculate document counts inline.
        
        Changes:
        - Remove view_riksdagen_politician_document reference
        - Add direct base table joins for document counting
        - Maintain all risk calculation logic unchanged
        - Keep LEFT JOIN semantics to handle missing documents gracefully
        
        Performance Note: This adds JOINs to 3-4 base tables instead of 1 materialized
        view, which may be slightly slower but ensures the view always works regardless
        of materialized view population status.

  Fix Empty Views: Ministry Intelligence Views v1.39
  Author: Intelligence Operative
  Date: 2025-12-01
  GitHub Issue: #8009 (Fix Empty View: view_ministry_effectiveness_trends)
  
  This changelog fixes three ministry intelligence views which have returned 0 rows
  despite previous fix attempts in issues #7883 and changelogs v1.31, v1.32, v1.37.
  
  Views Fixed:
  1. view_ministry_effectiveness_trends - Ministry effectiveness metrics over time (quarterly)
  2. view_ministry_productivity_matrix - Ministry productivity benchmarking (annual)
  3. view_ministry_risk_evolution - Ministry risk tracking over time (quarterly)
  
  Root Cause Identified:
  All three views filter assignment_data by org_code containing 'departement':
      WHERE LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%'
  
  However, actual department assignments in the data have:
  - org_code: Short codes like "KN", "N", "UD", "F", etc. (NOT containing "departement")
  - detail: Full ministry names like "Klimat- och näringslivsdepartementet" (DOES contain "departement")
  - assignment_type: "Departement" (correctly identifies ministry assignments)
  
  Example from sample data:
  - hjid: 257
  - assignment_type: "Departement"  ✓ correct
  - org_code: "KN"                   ✗ doesn't match LIKE '%departement%'
  - detail: "Klimat- och näringslivsdepartementet"  ✓ contains "departement"
  
  Solution:
  Change the filter to rely on assignment_type = 'Departement' only, 
  and remove the org_code LIKE '%departement%' condition which incorrectly
  filtered out all valid ministry assignments.
  
  Impact:
  - Unblocks all three ministry views (currently 0 rows → expected >10 rows each)
  - Enables ministry effectiveness tracking for Product Line 4 (Ministry & Government Intelligence)
  - Unblocks 4 ministry risk rules (M-01 through M-04)
  - Fixes related views that depend on these views

        Fix view_ministry_effectiveness_trends to return actual ministry data
        
        Root Cause: View filtered by LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%' but actual
        ministry org_codes are short codes ("KN", "N", etc.) that don't contain "departement".
        The text "departement" appears in the detail field, not org_code.
        
        Solution: Remove the LIKE '%departement%' filter. The assignment_type = 'Departement'
        filter is sufficient to identify ministry assignments.
        
        Changes:
        - Keep: assignment_type = 'Departement' (correctly identifies ministries)
        - Remove: LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%' (incorrectly filters out all data)
        - Keep: org_code IS NOT NULL (valid constraint)
        - Update: short_code extraction to handle actual short org_codes
        - Keep: All other logic unchanged (quarterly metrics, trends, assessments)

        Fix view_ministry_risk_evolution to return actual ministry data
        
        Root Cause: Same as view_ministry_effectiveness_trends - view filtered by 
        LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%' but actual ministry org_codes are short 
        codes ("KN", "N", etc.) that don't contain "departement".
        
        Solution: Remove the LIKE '%departement%' filter. The assignment_type = 'Departement'
        filter is sufficient to identify ministry assignments.
        
        Changes:
        - Keep: assignment_type = 'Departement' (correctly identifies ministries)
        - Remove: LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%' (incorrectly filters out all data)
        - Keep: org_code IS NOT NULL (valid constraint)
        - Keep: All other logic unchanged (quarterly performance, risk calculations)

        Documentation for v1.39 ministry views fix
        
        Summary:
        - Root cause: Incorrect filter on org_code LIKE '%departement%'
        - Actual data: org_code has short codes like 'KN', 'N', not full names
        - Solution: Remove LIKE filter, rely on assignment_type = 'Departement' only
        - Impact: Unblocks ministry intelligence tracking and 4 ministry risk rules
        
        Views Fixed:
        1. view_ministry_effectiveness_trends - Ministry effectiveness over time (quarterly)
        2. view_ministry_productivity_matrix - Ministry productivity benchmarking (annual)
        3. view_ministry_risk_evolution - Ministry risk tracking over time (quarterly)
        
        For CHANGELOG_DATABASE_VIEWS.md:
        - v1.39: Fixed three ministry views filter condition
        - Removed LOWER(org_code) LIKE '%departement%' constraint from all
        - Uses assignment_type = 'Departement' to identify ministries
        - Now returns data for actual ministry assignments
