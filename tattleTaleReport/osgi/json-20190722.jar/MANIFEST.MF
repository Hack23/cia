Bundle-Description: JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data i
 nterchange format.		See http://www.JSON.org/		The files in this package
  implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.		It also includes the capabi
 lity to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP		headers, Cookies, and CDL.	
 	This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON pa
 ckages		in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on
  one. Until		then, choose carefully.		The license includes this restric
 tion: "The software shall be used for good,		not evil." If your conscie
 nce cannot live with that, then choose a different		package.
